#  Bike-Sharing Assignment
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

In this assignment I have build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.


# Technologies used 
1. numpy - version 2.2.6
2. pandas - version 2.3.0
3. matplotlib - version 3.10.3
4. seaborn - version 0.13.2
5. statsmodels - version 0.14.4
6. sklearn - version 1.7.0
7. scipy - version 1.15.3


## Conclusion
The model identified several key variables that significantly influence bike-sharing demand.These include:
1. Temperature

2. Seasonal effects, particularly in winter and spring, as well as specific months like July, March, September, and November

3. Weather conditions, especially during misty/cloudy days or light snow

4. year, reflecting overall growth trends or long-term behavioral changes

These variables collectively help in accurately predicting fluctuations in the usage of shared bikes.
